As we learned earlier, the Ember convention is to place your source code in the app folder. 
For other assets like images and fonts, the convention is to put them in the public folder. 
We will follow this convention by downloading the image file and saving it into 
public/assets/images/teaching-tomster.png.

This time, we would like the page to be served on the /about URL. 
In order to do this, we will need to tell Ember about our plan to add a page at that location. 
Otherwise, Ember will think we have visited an invalid URL!

The place to manage what pages are available is the router.

SO TO ADD NEW PAGE FIRST I NEED TO VISIT ROUTER.JS.
and add code: 

Router.map(function () {
  this.route('about');
});

-------------

creating in templates about.hbs

this.route('contact', {path: 'getting-in-touch'});  <- alias is contact but the path will be 
getting-in-touch


Since Ember offers great support for URLs out-of-the-box, we could just link our pages together 
using the <a> tag with the appropriate href. But in ember they provide us <LinkTo>
syntax: 
<LinkTo @route="about" class="button">About</LinkTo>

<LinkTo>-  is an example of a component
@route  -  is how we pass arguments into the component
Note that this should be the name of the route, not the path, 
which is why we specified "about" instead of "/about"

passed without the @ symbol (class=... as opposed to @class=...), 
so that Ember will know they are just regular HTML attributes.

<LinkTo> avoid full page refresh in opposite to <a> which refresh all page by sending request to the server
------------------------------
TESTES
Adding Acceptance Tests with Generators

$ ember generate acceptance-test super-rentals
installing acceptance-test
  create tests/acceptance/super-rentals-test.js

This is called a generator command in Ember CLI.

follows the pattern ember generate <type> <name>, 
where <type> is the kind of thing we are generating, and <name> is what we want to call it.

we can call also ember g <type> <name>

acceptance test == application test

import { module, test } from 'qunit';
import { click, visit, currentURL } from '@ember/test-helpers';
import { setupApplicationTest } from 'ember-qunit';

module('Acceptance | super rentals', function (hooks) {
  setupApplicationTest(hooks);

  test('visiting /', async function (assert) {
    await visit('/');

    assert.strictEqual(currentURL(), '/');
    assert.dom('h2').hasText('Welcome to Super Rentals!');

    assert.dom('.jumbo a.button').hasText('About Us');
    await click('.jumbo a.button');

    assert.strictEqual(currentURL(), '/about');
  });
});


test('visiting /' ... - visit is ember test helper - it is like we type go to 
http://localhost:4200/ in the browser's address bar and hitting the enter key

!!!! AWAIT
await keyword. That way, it will wait until the page completely finishes loading before moving on to the next step.
any user interaction, needs to be await-ed.

await visit('/');
This is almost always the behavior we want, so we will almost always use await and visit as a pair.

assert.dom('.jumbo a.button')
"look inside the tag with the jumbo class for an <a> tag with the button class."


assert.strictEqual(currentURL(), '/about');
Finally, we asserted that clicking on the link should bring us to the /about URL.
