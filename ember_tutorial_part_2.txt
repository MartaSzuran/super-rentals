Routes with Dynamic Segments

app/router.js

import EmberRouter from '@ember/routing/router';
import config from 'super-rentals/config/environment';

export default class Router extends EmberRouter {
  location = config.locationType;
  rootURL = config.rootURL;
}

Router.map(function () {
  this.route('about');
  this.route('contact', { path: '/getting-in-touch' });
  this.route('rental', { path: '/rentals/:rental_id' });
});

:rental_id, which is what we call a dynamic segment. When these routes are evaluated, the rental_id 
will be substituted with the id of the individual rental property that we are trying to navigate to.
